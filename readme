- Student ID : S3495671
- Student Name : Wolf Zimmermann

#### Make
To make use the default make target

#### Usage
- arg 1
  - --g seed width height
    - Generates maze using aldus-broder
    - Seed is optional if left empty will use time since epoch
  - --lb filename
    - loads maze from binary
- arg 2
  - --sv filename
    - saves maze to svg
  - --sb filename
    - save maze to binary
    - formated
      - int height
      - int width
      - int number of edges
      - all edges in format
        - int x1
        - int y1
        - int x2
        - int y2

#### Design of program
1. Created functions for loading binary
2. Created Maze class
3. Created Vector of vectors to store cells and created a vector of edges also created stucts for cell and edges
4. Created SVG saving function
5. Moved Saving and loading operations inside of Maze class
6. Created Maze generation inside of maze class
7. Moved the function to a module so if more algorithims where to be used it would better to have this seperate from the maze
8. Implemented binary saving
9. handling of input flags
10. Clean up and finish
